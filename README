Lib vs Vanilla

The only difference between lib and vanilla, is that lib contains a map to common
frameworks so when using require you only need to use 'jQuery' to get the latest
jQuery library from Googles CDN. If you are using vanilla you will need to put
the whole URL/path to the files.


Hosted CDN
